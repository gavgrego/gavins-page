            <p>
              I have been engrossed with how the internet works since kindergarten, spending my time
              creating rudimentary websites as a child. Now I am a seasoned software engineer with{' '}
              <em>around a decade of experience</em> in various web and software technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
              My most recent 6+ years of professional work have been spent in Javascript and{' '}
              <em>TypeScript</em>, mostly in <em>React</em> and lately, <em>Next</em>. I truly enjoy
              working within the JavaScript ecosystem, learning about JavaScript, and how the web
              works as a whole.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addiiton to React, I have also touched so much else of{' '}
              <em>modern front-end and full-stack tooling</em> including <em>Vue</em>,{' '}
              <em>Laravel</em>, <em>Go</em>, <em>Astro</em>, <em>GraphQL</em>, various headless
              CMSes, various component libraries, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
              I add immense value not just as an engineer, but a team member. I pride myself on
              continuously improving, always showing up, and being an authentic person that peers
              enjoy working with and having around. I am a strong communicator, a good listener, and
              always striving to be better.
            </p>

            <p>
              ‚ùó Currently, I'm focusing on helping current and new clients succeed with their new
              and existing enterprise-level web applications and websites via my company,{' '}

                I have resided in the San Francisco Bay Area in beautiful Marin County with my wife
                since the Summer of 2021, previously residing in Indianapolis, Indiana. I love
                traveling, writing, photography, spending time outside, going to concerts, and
                spinning up a side project or two a year.
